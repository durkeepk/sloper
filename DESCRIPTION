Description: For now, it just computes a mixed model with random slopes/intercepts and extract slopes (and intercepts) for further use. 
    It might be cool if it could also be used to efficiently plot individual slopes and to maybe even do those additional analyses on the slopes (e.g. predict slope variation). 
    Don't know what else it might do yet...
