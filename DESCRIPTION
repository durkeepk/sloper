Description: For now, this package has functions for easily computing and visualizing mixed models.
    One function specifies a mixed model for lmer with random slopes/intercepts and extracts slopes (and intercepts) for further use. 
    It has a separate function to efficiently make a pretty plot of individual slopes and the overall slope. 
    Don't know what else it might do yet...
